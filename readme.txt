Convert taxonomy tags to checkboxes in the WordPress admin area.

== Description ==
This plugin lets you swap the auto-complete / search style interface for a checkbox list, without changing any underlying data.

It allows you to pick from a list of the existing tags, so that admin users do not need to remember each tag.

It doesn't allow new tags to be created on the fly, which keeps the tags list under control, although you can optionally enable an add / edit link.

= Features =
* Replace the tags ui with a checkbox list
* No alteration to front end functionality, or the underlying data / terms
* Option to control the height of the taxonomy metabox, between auto, full height, and custom (px)
* Show a link to the taxonomy edit screen via an "+ Add / Edit {taxononomy}" link
* Customization via filters

== Installation ==
1. Upload the entire "runthings-taxonomy-tags-to-checkboxes" folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to Settings > Taxonomies to configure your preferences.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I enable checkboxes for specific taxonomies? =
Go to the Taxonomies settings page, select the desired taxonomies, configure height options, and enable the edit link if needed.

= Does this permanently change the taxonomy data? =
No change is made to the underlying taxonomy or its terms. Only the admin interface is swapped out.

= Can I display system taxonomies? =
Yes, toggle the "Show system taxonomies" checkbox to view all available taxonomies.

= What user capabilities are required? =
The configuration screen needs a user with `manage_settings` cap to edit it, but the changes are applied to anyone with editor access to post types that displays those taxonomies.

= I have a feature idea / I've found a bug =
